Habitat and Geographic Range: In the past, lions could once be found in abundance all across the world, in places such as Africa, Asia, the Middle East, and Europe (Dubac et al., 2005). However, they are now only found in two distinct areas, and have thus been divided into two separate subspecies. Asiatic lions are highly endangered and can only be found in India, within the Gir Forest National Park (Bradford, 2014). On the other hand, African lions are more plentiful in comparison to Asiatic lions and can be found in regions of sub-Saharan Africa (“Lion,” 2016). 
In terms of habitat, African lions are a very diverse set of animals and seem to enjoy a vast subset of terrestrial habitats. Their most preferred habitats include grasslands, forests, savannas, open plains and woodlands, as well as semi-deserts and shrublands (Kays, 2018). These habitats provide lions with an abundance and variety of prey animals, along with an increased ability to use camouflage as a mechanism for survival and success (Kays, 2018). 

Size/Weight and Lifespan: Lions are amongst the largest of the big cats and are only smaller than some subspecies of tigers. According to National Geographic, African lions range from 4.5 – 6.5 feet, when measured from the head to the posterior of the body. In addition, their tails are approximately 26.25 – 39.5 inches long (“African Lion,” n.d.). Size differs amongst males and females, as male African lions tend to be larger than their female counterparts. Weight also differs amongst the two sexes, with males weighing slightly heavier than females. In general, the weight of the African lion ranges anywhere from 265 – 420 pounds (“African Lion,” n.d.). Similar to their size and weight, lions also live relatively long lives. The African lion has a life span of 10 – 14 years, although this may increase substantially if the animal is kept in captivity (Mayer, 2018).

Diet: Lions are carnivorous animals that prefer to feed on a wide range of prey that include small-sized animals such as rodents and large-sized animals such as buffalos (Kays, 2018). Although a variety of prey are consumed, they tend to have a keen interest in medium to large-sized animals such as zebras and antelopes (Kays, 2018). A 2013 study focusing on seasonal diet and prey preference amongst African lions living in savanna habitats found that diet preference differed depending on the season (Davidson et al.). Researchers observed eating behaviour and found that buffaloes were preferred all year around, while zebras were mainly hunted in the dry season (Davidson et al., 2013). Furthermore, elephants and giraffes were generally avoided during all seasons, however some female lions preferred to consume small amounts of elephant and giraffe in the wet and dry seasons, respectively (Davidson et al., 2013).

Reproduction and Communication: African lions are polygamous animals that do not have a specific mating season, but rather breed throughout the year (Kays, 2018). Males, who reach sexual maturity between the ages of three to five, can reproduce with several females, however females, who reach sexual maturity at the age of four, are generally limited to only one or two males (“Lion Reproduction,” n.d.). Females have a variable reproductive cycle, in which there is a period of receptive mating that lasts for roughly three to four days (Kays, 2018). During this time, they often roll on their backs out of restlessness, which is a behaviour that is detected by males along with the additional detection of the female’s urine (“How Do Lions Mate and Reproduce,” n.d.). Mating behaviour is then initiated, with the lions engaging in sexual activity countless times throughout the day, thereby increasing the likelihood of conception (Kays, 2018). Finally, approximately 108 days after conception, a female lion typically gives birth to two to four cubs (Kays, 2018). 
Lions live in groups called prides, and thus, must be able to communicate with one another as well as with other prides. To communicate, lions use both vocalizations as well as methods such as urination (Kays, 2018). Vocalizations tend to include meows, roars, grunts and moans, with the most common vocalization being the roar (“Let’s Communicate,” 2018). A lion’s roar can be heard from almost eight kilometers away and is used to indicate the lion’s location to other lions, and to warn other prides from approaching its territory (“Let’s Communicate,” 2018). Another form of communication within lions is urine detection. A 2017 study used various lion urine samples to determine if lions were able to use chemical odours to differentiate between the samples (Gilfillan, Vitale, McNutt & McComb). Researchers discovered that lion urine contains indications about both social group as well as sex, which lions use to differentiate between male and female, and to tell apart members of their pride from those of other prides (Gilfillan et al., 2017). 

Predation: Does the animal have any predators? Lions are commonly referred to as the kings of the jungle because they are apex predators; a predator at the top of its food chain, that is not normally preyed upon by other animals (Pala, 2006). Despite this however, cubs are often susceptible to attack by hyenas, leopards and black-backed jackals (Cushman, 2014). Furthermore, despite not having many outside predators, one of their main predators is other lions themselves. Naturally, when a male lion takes over a new territory, he kills the pride’s cubs because he is not biologically related to them (Cushman, 2014). Thus, adult male lions are vastly responsible for the deaths of several cubs every year (Main, 2013). 

Conservation Status: 
According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature, African lions are currently ‘vulnerable’ because they have a population that is gradually declining (“Lion,” 2016). In fact, the population of African lions has decreased by 43% in the past 21 years (“Lion,” n.d.). Unfortunately, the main reason behind this population decrease is human disruption of lion habitat, as well as hunting and poaching. Several types of conservation methods have been put into place in order to help this problem, including two unique conservation programs in Kenya. A 2014 study combined both programs into a single conservation treatment variable, and used previous data, in order to determine the efficacy of the programs (Hazzah et al.). Using linear models, researchers found that the first program resulted in an estimated 87 – 91% decrease in lions killed, whereas the second program decreased this variable by 99%, therefore showing very strong potential (Hazzah et al., 2014).

Did you know that a male lion’s mane is an indication of both his health and physical strength/power (Admin, 2013)? The colour of the mane is directly correlated with testosterone levels, and as a result, can change accordingly (Admin, 2013). Therefore, a male’s mane not only attracts females but serves to protect the male lion by keeping predators and other males away (Admin, 2013).

Finally, approximately 108 days after conception, a female lion typically gives birth to two to four cubs (Kays, 2018). 
Lions live in groups called prides, and thus, must be able to communicate with one another as well as with other prides. To communicate, lions use both vocalizations as well as methods such as urination (Kays, 2018). Vocalizations tend to include meows, roars, grunts and moans, with the most common vocalization being the roar (“Let’s Communicate,” 2018). A lion’s roar can be heard from almost eight kilometers away and is used to indicate the lion’s location to other lions, and to warn other prides from approaching its territory (“Let’s Communicate,” 2018). Another form of communication within lions is urine detection. A 2017 study used various lion urine samples to determine if lions were able to use chemical odours to differentiate between the samples (Gilfillan, Vitale, McNutt & McComb). Researchers discovered that lion urine contains indications about both social group as well as sex, which lions use to differentiate between male and female, and to tell apart members of their pride from those of other prides (Gilfillan et al., 2017). 

Predation: Does the animal have any predators? Lions are commonly referred to as the kings of the jungle because they are apex predators; a predator at the top of its food chain, that is not normally preyed upon by other animals (Pala, 2006). Despite this however, cubs are often susceptible to attack by hyenas, leopards and black-backed jackals (Cushman, 2014). Furthermore, despite not having many outside predators, one of their main predators is other lions themselves. Naturally, when a male lion takes over a new territory, he kills the pride’s cubs because he is not biologically related to them (Cushman, 2014). Thus, adult male lions are vastly responsible for the deaths of several cubs every year (Main, 2013). 

Conservation Status: 
According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature, African lions are currently ‘vulnerable’ because they have a population that is gradually declining (“Lion,” 2016). In fact, the population of African lions has decreased by 43% in the past 21 years (“Lion,” n.d.). Unfortunately, the main reason behind this population decrease is human disruption of lion habitat, as well as hunting and poaching. Several types of conservation methods have been put into place in order to help this problem, including two unique conservation programs in Kenya. A 2014 study combined both programs into a single conservation treatment variable, and used previous data, in order to determine the efficacy of the programs (Hazzah et al.). Using linear models, researchers found that the first program resulted in an estimated 87 – 91% decrease in lions killed, whereas the second program decreased this variable by 99%, therefore showing very strong potential (Hazzah et al., 2014).

Did you know that a male lion’s mane is an indication of both his health and physical strength/power (Admin, 2013)? The colour of the mane is directly correlated with testosterone levels, and as a result, can change accordingly (Admin, 2013). Therefore, a male’s mane not only attracts females but serves to protect the male lion by keeping predators and other males away (Admin, 2013).

Habitat and Geographic Range: In the past, lions could once be found in abundance all across the world, in places such as Africa, Asia, the Middle East, and Europe (Dubac et al., 2005). However, they are now only found in two distinct areas, and have thus been divided into two separate subspecies. Asiatic lions are highly endangered and can only be found in India, within the Gir Forest National Park (Bradford, 2014). On the other hand, African lions are more plentiful in comparison to Asiatic lions and can be found in regions of sub-Saharan Africa (“Lion,” 2016). 
In terms of habitat, African lions are a very diverse set of animals and seem to enjoy a vast subset of terrestrial habitats. Their most preferred habitats include grasslands, forests, savannas, open plains and woodlands, as well as semi-deserts and shrublands (Kays, 2018). These habitats provide lions with an abundance and variety of prey animals, along with an increased ability to use camouflage as a mechanism for survival and success (Kays, 2018). 

Size/Weight and Lifespan: Lions are amongst the largest of the big cats and are only smaller than some subspecies of tigers. According to National Geographic, African lions range from 4.5 – 6.5 feet, when measured from the head to the posterior of the body. In addition, their tails are approximately 26.25 – 39.5 inches long (“African Lion,” n.d.). Size differs amongst males and females, as male African lions tend to be larger than their female counterparts. Weight also differs amongst the two sexes, with males weighing slightly heavier than females. In general, the weight of the African lion ranges anywhere from 265 – 420 pounds (“African Lion,” n.d.). Similar to their size and weight, lions also live relatively long lives. The African lion has a life span of 10 – 14 years, although this may increase substantially if the animal is kept in captivity (Mayer, 2018).

Diet: Lions are carnivorous animals that prefer to feed on a wide range of prey that include small-sized animals such as rodents and large-sized animals such as buffalos (Kays, 2018). Although a variety of prey are consumed, they tend to have a keen interest in medium to large-sized animals such as zebras and antelopes (Kays, 2018). A 2013 study focusing on seasonal diet and prey preference amongst African lions living in savanna habitats found that diet preference differed depending on the season (Davidson et al.). Researchers observed eating behaviour and found that buffaloes were preferred all year around, while zebras were mainly hunted in the dry season (Davidson et al., 2013). Furthermore, elephants and giraffes were generally avoided during all seasons, however some female lions preferred to consume small amounts of elephant and giraffe in the wet and dry seasons, respectively (Davidson et al., 2013).

Reproduction and Communication: African lions are polygamous animals that do not have a specific mating season, but rather breed throughout the year (Kays, 2018). Males, who reach sexual maturity between the ages of three to five, can reproduce with several females, however females, who reach sexual maturity at the age of four, are generally limited to only one or two males (“Lion Reproduction,” n.d.). Females have a variable reproductive cycle, in which there is a period of receptive mating that lasts for roughly three to four days (Kays, 2018). During this time, they often roll on their backs out of restlessness, which is a behaviour that is detected by males along with the additional detection of the female’s urine (“How Do Lions Mate and Reproduce,” n.d.). Mating behaviour is then initiated, with the lions engaging in sexual activity countless times throughout the day, thereby increasing the likelihood of conception (Kays, 2018). Finally, approximately 108 days after conception, a female lion typically gives birth to two to four cubs (Kays, 2018).

Lots of wildlife conflict in area and a consistent pattern of poaching activities. This male is likely to have been the one I observed in June 2022--who generally stayed near the HQ and it was said often pulled out the HQ water pipe.  Perhaps the elephant was reluctant to go down to the water where it was easier to be attacked?  The location of this poaching incident was just at the water, where it would have been easy to move the meat and tusks on a boat.  Quite a tragic thing to see.",277
